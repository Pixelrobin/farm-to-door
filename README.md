## FBLA 2018 Topic
Develop an e-business website for your new “fresh food” (i.e. prepared meals, ingredients to make meals, natural foods, etc.) home delivery service for your community of 250,000 residents. Since it is a delivery service, there is room to expand your geographic delivery area. Give your business a name and a logo. Your service will have a variety of delivery options to meet the needs of different types of customers (i.e. meat, vegetarian, vegan, family, couples, gluten-free, etc.). The website should clearly identify the target market locations and its product availability. The website should allow customers to check availability of products, place and pay for orders online as a one-time customer, or become a member and set up plans for a calendar year. The site should also contain a contact page.
